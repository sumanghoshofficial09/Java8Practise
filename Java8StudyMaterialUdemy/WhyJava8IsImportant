Java is most popular and widely accepted language in the world 

it is already most popular language why the java creators decided to change 

Java creator wants to introduce the Functional Feature like lambda , stream 
like Optional etc



Technological advancement :

nowadays even mobile device has multipe processors
we need to use multi threading to use all the processor effectively 

we all know that working with thread is so touchy we need to careful while working 
with thread


with Java8 we can write functional programming code with new functional programming concept 


which is going to help us in simplyfying the concurrency operation 

which will make use of multiple processor whenver you use concurrency operation 

it supports creating immutable object which is going to solve a lots of problem in 
java application :

Mutable objects are source of many errors in java applications 

functional programming highly discourages mutating an object 

functional programming going to let you write more concise and readable code 

in java8 it is going to allow you use function or methods as first class citizens 


in functional programming , you are going to create a function , you can assign the functionality 

to a variable and pass it to as parameter to other method 


Function<String,String> addSomeString = (name) -> name.toUpperCase().concat("default")

the first param represent an input and second param in generic represent an output 

we have a new syntax here -> , this syntax is called lambda expression 

above line we are expecting an input string then we are performing Uppercase operation there 

and then we are performing concat operation there 


and this whole logic is assigned to a variable called addSomeString 

we can pass this addSomeString as anyother variable like java 

in java 8 we can write the code as Declarative way 

rather than an imperative way 

what is the difference between imperative way and declarative way 
-------------------------------------------------

lets talk about imperative style of programming 

this style of programming focused how to get the result that you want 

this style of programming enbraces an object state to acheive some goal 

so this style of programming supports Object mutability 

to achieve an goal , you define the list of steps 

you write the code what needs to be done in each step 

class object oriented programming style 



--------------------------------


Now lets talk about Declarative programming 

this style of programmming focuses on what is the result you want , 
dont want worry about the how to get the result 

this style of programming embraces object immutability 


this style of programming is analogous to SQL 

in sql we only care about the to get the data from table 

but we dont care about the algorithm used to fetch data from db table 


use the function that is already part of the library to achive the objective 

--------------------------------

in java8 they a lots of function got introduced 

to make you of those function in order to get the result you want 

no need to worry about hwo the data get processed behind the scene 

Functional programming uses the concept of declarative programming
