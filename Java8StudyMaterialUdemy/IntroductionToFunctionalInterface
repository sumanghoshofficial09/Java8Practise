functional interface is presnt in java since jdk 1.0

those were referred as Single Abstract Method Interfaces 

Concept are same but they are categorized into

as per java documentation , the definition is that 


Functional interface is an interface which has only one abstract method 


We have seen this annotation @FunctionalInterface which got introduced in java8


and all the interfaces which has one abstract method , are annotated with functional Interfaces 

,this is oprtional annotation , but it is helping interface in validating the contract that interface must have only one abstract method 


New Functional Interface got introduced in java 8 


the four primary interfaces are 
---------------------------------

Consumer 

Predicate 

Function 

Supplier 

each and every functional interfaces have their own extension 


for Consumer , we have BiConsumer 


for predicate we have BiPredicate 

Function : BiFunction , UnaryOperator , BinaryOperator 

you might be wondering I dont use any of the interfaces in my curreeny project still my application is working like a charm

why do we have to learn these interfaces : 


we are going to learn all those enhancement made to the collections 

such that list , map set that uses these interfaces which is going to make your develpement realy realy faster
