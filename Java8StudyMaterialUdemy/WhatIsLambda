{}  lambda body is provide with in curly braces 

the body is the one which is going to hold the actual content

Usages of Lambda 
---------------------

Lambda 's main purpose is to implement the functional interface 


functional interfaces in other word called the SAM 

Single Abstract method Interfaces 
--------------------------------------


@FunctionalInterfaces
public interface Comparator<T>
{

	int compare(T o1, T o2);
}

@FunctionalInterface 

public interface Runnable {


	public abstract void run();


}
